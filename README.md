# SwedishCWIdataset

This dataset is contains words and their annotated complexity level, word lengths and the frequencies of each word in three corpora. The purpose of the dataset is to facilitate training Complex Word Identification (CWI) systems. The dataset is based on the SwedishCWI dataset developed by Smolenska (2018), who annotated the word complexity levels in the dataset as a part of the Master's thesis "Complex Word Identification for Swedish".
